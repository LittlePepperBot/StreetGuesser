This fork was made to help people learn new streets around the GTA V map. 
While the original project had a street guesser, it was (almost) every street all at once.
This project aims to make it easier to learn different sections of the map at a time. 


There are still some bugs and quirks to work out with the project.


This a Fork from the Unoffical Online MDW for the NoPixel WL GTA-RP server. You can find the original from the link below.
